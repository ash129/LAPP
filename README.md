LAPP
====

Ligand Analysis with Physiochemical Properties (LAPP) is a small package I made to study HLA peptidomes. It has various functions for data conversion, visualization, and prediction.

If you're in my work with immunogenetics, check out my project page here: <https://ash129.github.io/LAPP/index.html>

Installation
------------

You can install LAPP in R with the following commands

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("ash129/LAPP")
```

Usage
-----

The package vignette is still under construction. Check again soon!
